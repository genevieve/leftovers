To prevent clients from overwriting each other's changes, PUT operations must include the current _revision of the resource, which clients should obtain by issuing a GET operation. If the _revision provided in a PUT request is missing or stale, the operation will be rejected.

NOT_PROTECTED - the client who retrieved the entity is allowed                 to modify it REQUIRE_OVERRIDE - the client who retrieved the entity is a super                    user and can modify it, but only when providing                    the request header X-Allow-Overwrite=true. UNKNOWN - the _protection field could not be determined for this           entity.

	// In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their health, completely independent of any data traffic. Active healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled for a server pool by binding a health monitor to the pool. Currently, only one active health monitor can be configured per server pool.

	// Load balancing algorithm, configurable per pool controls how the incoming connections are distributed among the members.

	MinActiveMembers int64 `json:"min_active_members,omitempty"`

	// Passive healthchecks are disabled by default and can be enabled by attaching a passive health monitor to a server pool. Each time a client connection to a pool member fails, its failed count is incremented. For pools bound to L7 virtual servers, a connection is considered to be failed and failed count is incremented if any TCP connection errors (e.g. TCP RST or failure to send data) or SSL handshake failures occur. For pools bound to L4 virtual servers, if no response is received to a TCP SYN sent to the pool member or if a TCP RST is received in response to a TCP SYN, then the pool member is considered to have failed and the failed count is incremented.
	PassiveMonitorId string `json:"passive_monitor_id,omitempty"`

	// Depending on the topology, Source NAT (SNAT) may be required to ensure traffic from the server destined to the client is received by the load balancer. SNAT can be enabled per pool. If SNAT is not enabled for a pool, then load balancer uses the client IP and port (spoofing) while establishing connections to the servers. This is referred to as no-SNAT or TRANSPARENT mode.
	SnatTranslation *LbSnatTranslation `json:"snat_translation,omitempty"`

	// TCP multiplexing allows the same TCP connection between load balancer and the backend server to be used for sending multiple client requests from different client TCP connections.

	TcpMultiplexingNumber int64 `json:"tcp_multiplexing_number,omitempty"`
