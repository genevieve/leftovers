	// Load balancers monitor the health of backend servers to ensure traffic is not black holed. There are two types of healthchecks: active and passive. Passive healthchecks depend on failures in actual client traffic (e.g. RST from server in response to a client connection) to detect that the server or the application is down. In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their health, completely independent of any data traffic. Currently, active health monitors are supported for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols.

	MonitorPort string `json:"monitor_port,omitempty"`

	// num of consecutive checks must pass before marking it up
	RiseCount int64 `json:"rise_count,omitempty"`

	// the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request
	Timeout int64 `json:"timeout,omitempty"`

	// Expected data, if specified, can be anywhere in the response and it has to be a string, regular expressions are not supported.
	Receive string `json:"receive,omitempty"`

	// If both send and receive are not specified, then just a TCP connection is established (3-way handshake) to validate server is healthy, no data is sent.
	Send string `json:"send,omitempty"`
